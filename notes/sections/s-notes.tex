\paragraph{Miscellaneous}

\begin{boenumerate}
\item The formatting of the thousands is not done properly.
\end{boenumerate}

\paragraph{Reports}

\begin{boenumerate}
\item Regarding the referee's first comment, I will have Tobias and Christian read the paper and interview them afterwards.
\item The new paper by Keane on smoothing \citep{Bruins.2015}, ask referee if reference is correct. Set up secure channel to communicate? I am thinking of a graph that shows the RMSE as a function of smoothing parameter. Or let the estimator run and then from converged point restart with smaller bandwidth, etc... Note that this is another tuning parameter, among many others (etc. optimizer) that has nothing to do with the approximation method.
\item I need an overview statistic capturing the advances in computing power and then I will do exactly what the referee asks for.
\item The recomputation instructions never state that I imagine them having Ubuntu.
\end{boenumerate}
