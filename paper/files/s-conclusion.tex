I successfully recompute key results from \citet{Keane.1994} and provide some additional diagnostics that highlight the trade-off between computation time and reliability of results. Thus, I draw attention to the original authors repeated warnings that the performance of their proposed interpolation scheme needs to be carefully assessed by researchers in their particular setting. A pragmatic approach is to successively increase the number of interpolation points as the estimation progresses towards the final results.
